Final-Project//
The company "Sib" is a leading exporter of non-oil products to various countries around the world. In order to improve the company's business performance, they have hired you as a data analyst at their headquarters in Iran.
This project has been designed for you in the following five stages:
Data Preprocessing: In this section, besides getting more familiar with the project data, you will perform a series of preparation and preprocessing steps on the entire dataset.
Exploration: In this step, we will answer a series of high-level questions and gain an intuitive understanding of the company's financial data.
Target Market Study: In the third step, we will analyze the sales locations and examine in which countries, despite having many customers, the company experiences low sales.
Customer Valuation: In this step, we introduce a practical metric called RFM, and based on this metric, we will divide the company's customers into 7 categories, each of which has its own specific meaning and behavior from a marketing perspective.
Customer Retention Analysis: In the final step, we aim to understand what percentage of customers, after their first purchase, continue to buy from the company in the following months.


Second-Project//
In this project, we are dealing with real data of houses in Beijing and conducting comprehensive and useful analyses on this dataset, while visualizing the results of the analyses through charts.

The project consists of five main sections:

In the first section, the data is read, and columns that are not needed will be removed. Missing values will also be handled.
In the second section, columns are converted to the appropriate format, and outliers are removed.
In the third section, new features are created using the existing ones, which will be very useful in the next two steps.
In the fourth section, using the latitude and longitude of the houses, they are displayed on a map to gain an overall view of the area.
In the final step, using the transaction dates, a temporal analysis of the completed transactions is conducted.
